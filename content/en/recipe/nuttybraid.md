## Tools

- Baking tray, either oiled or with baking paper
- Good mixer with dough hook or patience
- Small sauce pan
- Large bowl
- Tablespoon
- Teaspoon

## Ingredients

- One recipe [brioche]({{< ref "brioche" >}})
- 65ml plant-based milk, I've used coconut
- 10ml (1 Tablespoon) Maple syrup
- 40-70g brown sugar to taste. 70g was too sweet for me, but I eat no sugar - YMMV
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 dusting of nutmeg (idk, three or four microplane iterations?)
- Optional, probably delicious: Green cardamom, anisseed and a clove, gently heated in a pan to draw out the oils and then pulverized in a mortar
- 200g chopped walnuts, hazelnuts, ...
- 50g ground walnuts, hazelnuts, ...
- Juice and zest of half a lemon

## Method

Create the nut filling from the non-brioche ingredients by first heating milk, maple syrup, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a
sauce pan on medium heat. Do not cook, we just want to dissolve the sugar. Dump your nuts in. Set aside to cool.

Craft one [brioche]({{< ref "brioche" >}}), to the point at which you'd separate the dough into your bread tin. Roll out into a 30*40cm rectangle. Spread nuts all over your
dough and roll up from the long side. Place the roll with the overlap at the bottom.

To form the braid, cut roll lengthwise in half, starting from the middle. Turning the
insides up, form a braid. Continue with the rest of the roll so that the braid is not
too loose and can be formed easily.

In order for the ends to stick together better, either wet them with water or plant-based milk and gently press them together. Or simply fold them under your braid.

Let rest covered on your baking tray for 45 minutes, meanwhile preheat an oven to 180° Celsius. After resting, bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the core temperate is at 90° Celsius.

## Bonus

For a nice sheen without that stupid sugar:

- 5g starch (potato, maize, tapioka)
- 100ml water

Take one or two tablespoons of your water to mix with the starch, ensuring no clumps
can form. Boil the rest, and pour it over your starch mix. This slurry keeps in the fridge for a couple of days. To use, heat it up and brush onto your hot-from-the-oven
bread or other baked good.
