## Tools

- Baking tray, either oiled or with baking paper
- Good mixer with dough hook or patience
- Small sauce pan
- Large bowl
- Tablespoon
- Teaspoon

## Ingredients

- One recipe [brioche]({{< ref "brioche" >}})
- 65ml plant-based milk, I've used coconut
- 10ml (1 Tablespoon) Maple syrup
- 40-70g brown sugar to taste. 70g was too sweet for me, but I eat no sugar - YMMV
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 dusting of nutmeg (idk, three or four microplane iterations?)
- Optional, probably delicious: Green cardamom, anisseed and a clove, gently heated in a pan to draw out the oils and then pulverized in a mortar
- 200g chopped walnuts, hazelnuts, ...
- 50g ground walnuts, hazelnuts, ...
- Juice and zest of half a lemon

## Method

Create the nut filling from the non-brioche ingredients by first heating milk, maple syrup, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a
sauce pan on medium heat. Do not cook, we just want to dissolve the sugar. Dump your nuts in. Set aside to cool.

Craft one [brioche]({{< ref "brioche" >}}), to the point at which you'd separate the dough into your bread tin. Divide into three pieces.

Roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface and spread a third of your nuts on it. Roll up from the long side. The ends may end up
slightly thinner to make it easier to finish your braid.

After filling all three pieces, form a braid! Wet the ends with plant-based milk or water to have them stick together better if necessary.

Let rest covered on your baking tray for 45 minutes, meanwhile preheat an oven to 180Â° Celsius. After resting, bake for about 45 minutes.
