This recipe is based on the pizza recipe in Karen Davies' book [Savour](http://savourcookbook.com/) which you should absolutely buy! I've adapted
it slightly to the spelt flour I use.

## Tools

- Big bowl
- Spoon
- Decent-sized work surface or machine with dough hook attachment

## Ingredients

- 500g spelt flour
- 100ml apple juice (100% juice, not that sugary crap)
- 200ml water
- 1 sachet of dry yeast (7g)
- 3 Tablespoons good olive oil
- 2 Teaspoons salt
- 1 Tablespoon of Oregano (optional)

## Method

- Mix flour, yeast, apple juice and water roughly and set aside, covered, for 45 minutes
- Add oil, salt and the optional oregani, and knead up to five minutes - spelt has a higher gluten content and needs less kneading time
- Using both hands, drag on work surface to form a tight ball
- Drop dough ball into big bowl, cover with a cloth or a lid
- Arise, sir dough! Let the dough proof for at least an hour
  - Overnight: Take only a quarter of yeast and let proof over night in fridge
  - Up to 8h: After ~90 minutes, take dough out of bowl and gently fold 4-5 times. Do this two times
- Form into balls of about 250g per pizza, and use the rest of the dough for nice breadsticks or rolls (~80g each)
- Preheat oven to "piping hot", stretch out your dough and add toppings
- Bake! 250° C: ~10-12 minutes, 180° C: 20+ minutes
