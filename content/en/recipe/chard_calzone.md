## Tools

- Big enough pot or sauce pan
- Spoon
- Two baking trays, lined with parchment or sprinkled with semola

## Ingredients

- 1 recipe [pizza]({{< ref "pizza" >}}) without the toppings...
- 400g chard, including stems
- 1-2 red onions
- 1-2 cloves of garlic
- 400g tomato puree
- 2 Tablespoons of capers (I use salted capers, which I rinse off)
- 2 Tablespoons of black olives (without pits)
- 40g potato starch

## Method

The filling can be prepared beforehand, as it is easier to fill if the filling is cold and a bit less fluid.

- Prepare the dough
- While the dough does its thing, wash the chard and separately chop leaves and steams
- Finely (!) chop the onions. You can also use eschalottes for a more delicate taste
- Peel the garlic, chop the capers and olives
- In a sauce pan on medium heat, sweat off the onions in a little oil, add the stems as well
- Once the steams are tender and giving off a good aroma, add grated garlic, chard leaves and let wilt down
- Once the chard is wilted down, add tomato puree, capers and olives
- Dissolve the potato starch in about 40ml of water, taking care to mix thoroughly until there are no lumps
- Pour starch slurry into pot, turn up the heat to a boil, and while stirring, let the sauce thicken a bit
- Turn off the heat, continue stirring for a minute, set aside to cool
- When ready to fill, make balls of 80g for mini calzones, or just use half the dough for a big boi.
- Using your hands, on an oiled or semola-d work surface, stretch out the dough to a large circle
- Place filling in the middle, gently fold dough over, forming a half circle
- Close the seams! You can try pleating, or simply use a fork to press down on the seam
- Baking times are the same as in the [pizza]({{< ref "pizza" >}}) recipe
