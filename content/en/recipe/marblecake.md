## Tools

- Rectangular cake pan or Bundt pan
- Mixing implement
- 2 large bowls
- Tablespoon
- Fork

## Ingredients

- 400g flour. I use spelt, standard non-self-raising flour works the same. Just don't mix it too long
- 100-200g sugar. Classic taste: 200g, still delicious: 100g
- 250ml - 280ml Plant-based milk. Coconut and soy both tasted great
- 10g starch
- Pinch of salt
- 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 packet of baking powder (in Germany: 17g)
- 250g luke-warm vegan butter. I am using the green Alsan
- 20g dutch-processed cocoa powder

## Method

- Preheat oven to 180Â° Circotherm, grease your pan
- Mix butter and sugar
- Mix milk and vanilla extract into butter
- Mix flour, baking powder, starch, salt . Add into buttery sugar milk. Mmmmh, buttery
- Mix juuust well enough. We want marble cake, not marble bread.
- Pur half of your dough into the second bowl. That is: 450g-550g
- Mix cocoa powder into second half of dough.
- Pour light dough into cake pan
- Pour dark dough on top
- Marble it by making a wave pattern with your fork, occasionally mixing from top to bottom
- Bake for an hour, do a quick check after about 50 minutes
- Let cool in the baking tin for half an hour, then tip onto wire rack and resist eating it right away.
- If the cake is fully cooled down, dig in. Or make it pretty with chocolate glaze or powdered sugar.

Voila!
