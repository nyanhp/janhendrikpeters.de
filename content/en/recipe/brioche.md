## Ingredients

## Tools

- Rectangular bread pan - we're making a rectangular bread... 
- Good mixer with dough hook or patience
- Small sauce pan
- Large bowl
- Tablespoon
- Teaspoon

### Roux, Yukone, Tangzhong

- 25g plain flour. Remarks: I've used both my own self-ground spelt flour, sieved, as well as standard German Type 405 plain flour without additives
- 125g fatty plant milk. I've used Coconut.

### Main dough

- 475g plain flour, see above
- 60g sugar. I've used cane sugar, but any fine sugar apart from powdered sugar works.
- 60g cold vegan butter, small cubes of about 5*5mm
- 1 vegan egg, either pre-made or DIY with 5g ground linseed and 50g sparkling water
- 200g fatty plant milk, see above
- 7g (1 sachet) dry yeast or half that if you leave the brioche to prove over night
- Half a teaspoon of salt (should be about 5g)

## Method

### Roux, Yukone, Tangzhong

- Make a roux! In a small sauce pan, stir the flour into the milk
- Heat the milk on a medium heat and stir continuously
- Take the pan off the heat once the bottom of the pan is left clean after your whisking, i.e. the roux has formed
- Chill it - either covered in a fridge, or stir it in a cold water bath if you're in a hurry

### Main dough

- Combine flour, sugar, cubed butter, egg, milk, yeast and the Yukone from earlier and roughly mix with a spoon
- Cover and set aside for 30-45 minutes. The [autolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autolysis_(biology)) will ensure you have a good dough that is hard to overknead!
- Mix in the salt and knead well. I've used a Kitchen Aid with a dough hook. The dough will feel very wet at first, which is why I give it about 5 minutes in the machine, before I continue by hand. The dough should be glossy and smooth. If you pinch off a bit and stretch it between your fingers gently, it should not immediately tear, but for a see-through thin sheet. Stop kneading once you reach this stage. Spelt dough will require not more than 5 minutes of kneading due to its high gluten content, so be a bit more careful with it. Wheat is more forgiving.
- Work into a ball with both hands by pulling the dough towards you while lightly pressing down on it with your palms.
- Use dough ball with bowl, use cloth with bowl, set aside for one hour to prove.
- After one hour the dough should have increased in volume. Take it out gently, fold it once or twice, and pinch off 5-10 pieces of roughly equal size
- Gently form pinched-off pieces into balls and lightly press into the baking pan
- Cover with cloth, not too tight, and set aside for another 45 minutes OR let rest over night in the fridge for even more fragrant dough.
- Bake in a preheated oven at 180° Celsius for about 45 minutes, or until the core temperature reaches 90° Celsius
- Let cool in the opened oven for 10-15 minutes, then tip it out onto a wire rack and let cool completely

Enjoy! The roux ensures that more water can be added to the dough. The original recipe only had about 60% hydration, whereas a yudane/yukone/tangzhong dough
should aim for 75% - a lot! By using the roux, your brioche (and other baked goods) remain fresh and moist for longer. It's not a big hassle, as well! Cooking the roux takes no more than five minutes, and you can prepare it beforehand and put it in the fridge.

The flour to liquid ratio is 1:5 (25g of flour equals 125g of coconut milk), and both ingredients are subtracted from the ingredients of your recipe! Zack, feddich, as we say.
With a little math, you should then increase hydration to 75%. Example: 500g flour, 250g milk, 1 egg equals 60% hydration (300g / 500g = 0.6). So to get to 75%, we need an additional 75g of fluid!
