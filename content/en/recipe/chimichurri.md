## Tools

- A good, sharp chef's knife or other knife large enough to chop parsley
- A bowl

## Ingredients

- 125ml good olive oil
- 30ml red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
- About 20-30g flat-leaf parsley - leaves only!
- 3-4 Cloves of garlic
- 2g or half a teaspoon dried oregano
- 5g or one teaspoon of good, coarse sea salt
- 1-2 Chili (Think: Birdeye, Peri Peri, Cayenne, Chile de arbol)

## Method

- Finely chop the leaves of your parsley. The woody stems at least should be excluded, you can get away with leaving the more tender stems in.
- Finely chop the garlic, grate it if you don't like chopping garlic or your knife is too dull
- Mix everything in a bowl. Give it a taste, and let rest for at least an hour for the flavours to develop
- Want to try for a mellow aroma? Slowly (!) bloom chili, oregano and garlic in the oil, no more than a medium heat. Let cool completely and then mix with the rest
