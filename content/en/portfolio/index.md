## Certs

Lots! You can find them here: <https://www.credly.com/users/jan-hendrik-peters/badges> and here: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/nyanhp/transcript/vpmq8amq008nqex>

## Development

Free code for everyone is important to me. Whenever I am able to, I'll contribute
to open-source projects. Sometimes, I am a bit more involved:

- https://github.com/automatedlab/automatedlab: Automate lab or training environments on Hyper-V or Azure with ease
- https://github.com/dsccommunity/dscworkshop: Infrastructure-as-code blueprint for new projects
- https://gitub.com/dsccommunity/commontasks: DSC composites, used with or without the blueprint project
- https://github.com/nyanhp/pstranslate: Translations (using cloud services) in PowerShell - no, this site
is translated by me personally...

## Talks

Apart from publicly available recordings of my talks, I also talked at the Nordic Infrastructure Conference, 
PowerShell Conference Asia in Singapore und Bangalore as well as at internal Microsoft conferences for 
audiences up to 200 people.
