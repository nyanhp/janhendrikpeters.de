## About me

Hi there :wave:

![JHP stares slightly irritated into the camera. Above him, affixed to the wall, a gigantic pair of aurochs horns that look like they are growing outside his head](/img/jhp.png)

I am named after this site, work in IT, but would rather be doing other stuff:
- Brewing beer (!)
- Blacksmithing
- Smoking (meats, cheeses, ...)
- Baking
- VFR flight
- Sports

If I do develop, it's usually for <https://automatedlab.org> or in the [DSC Community](https://dsccommunity.org).
